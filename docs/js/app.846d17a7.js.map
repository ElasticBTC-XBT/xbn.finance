Macroeconomics</h4>\n              <p>\n                In developing the XBT protocol, we explored a wide range of questions around the open areas of\n                research in money today, and found the concept of \"denationalized money” to be helpful for understanding\n                how cryptocurrencies fit into a broader context.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Drawing the connection between a technology innovation (cryptocurrencies) and an economic concept\n                (denationalized money) allows us to benefit from the rich academic literature devoted to understanding\n                where modern day monies face their greatest difficulties and where independent monies create value.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The mandate of denationalized money is to check against inflation and boom-bust cycles. Both of these\n                forces emerge from otherwise highly effective central banking systems, which is why economists have\n                assigned the task of checking them to monetary-assets that operate independently of government. Today's\n                decentralized cryptocurrencies are uniquely suited to this role, and in our opinion it will be their\n                most important economic function.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </c-generic-section>\n\n          <c-generic-section top-divider>\n            <div class=\"container-xs\">\n              <h4>2.

Economically, it is as if only one new asset has been introduced because adding\n                more identically-designed cryptocurrencies offers no marginal optionality.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </c-generic-section>\n\n          <c-generic-section top-divider>\n            <div class=\"container-xs\">\n              <h4>3. XBT introduces a Second Movement Pattern</h4>\n              <p>\n                XBT brings diversity to the ecosystem through a countercyclical supply policy that automatically and\n                proportionally adjusts supply across wallets in response to demand.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                This policy was designed to be the simplest direct solution to the supply inelasticity problem that\n                limits assets like gold and bitcoin.

As a result,\n                profit-maximizing actors are compelled to devise new trading strategies. This new behavior generates a\n                step-function-like movement pattern that is distinct from Bitcoin and traditional assets.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </c-generic-section>\n\n          <c-generic-section top-divider>\n            <div class=\"container-xs\">\n              <h4>4.

Tomorrow XBT Can Be A Better Bitcoin</h4>\n              <p> The XBT protocol automatically translates price-volatility into supply-volatility. But it is\n                profit-seeking traders, acting on incentives, who propagate these supply changes back into price. In\n                other words price informs supply algorithmically, while supply informs price behaviorally, in a cycle.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                This cycle takes the form of a step-function-like movement pattern that alternates between static\n                periods, where price and supply are in equilibrium, and dynamic periods where the market searches for\n                its next equilibrium.\n              </p>\n              <h4>\n                Lifecycle\n              </h4>\n              <p>\n                Early on, while XBT's market cap is small, wallet balances will be volatile. Dynamic periods will occur\n                frequently as the system snaps from one supply equilibrium to the next, reflecting the rapid changes in\n                demand for XBT. In this period of its lifecycle, XBT benefits from use as a diversifying asset to be\n                held in investment portfolios, and from use as a decentralized collateral asset.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Later on, as XBT's market cap grows, equilibrium periods will last for longer stretches of time. In\n                these static periods XBT is relatively stable in both price and wallet balance. At saturation, these\n                static periods would only be interrupted by macroeconomic changes in demand. These macroeconomic\n                interruptions, however unpredictable, would actually be desirable because such elasticity prevents\n                demand shocks from cascading into liquidity crunches and deflationary spirals.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Bitcoin will become less volatile at saturation, fully stabilizing in supply, but will never be stable\n                in price. And like other fixed supply assets Bitcoin will be vulnerable to sudden shocks in demand,\n                which limits the size and scope of economies that can be built ontop of it.\n              </p>\n              <h4>Denomination</h4>\n              <p>\n                Lastly, we'll note that even when supply is volatile, XBT can be used as a unit of account. Use in this\n                regard would be major step forward for crytocurrencies, because it means the currency would have a\n                real-exchange-rate (ie: 1 XBT for 1 can of soda) in addition to a nominal-exchange-rate (ie: 10000 XBT\n                for 1 BTC).\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Because real-exchange-rates are much more resistant to change than nominal-exchange-rates, the use of a\n                currency for denomination contributes to what Economists refer to as nominal rigidity (or price and wage\n                stickiness).\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                This stickiness further allows currencies like the USD to resist macroeconomic shocks, and has played a\n                major role in the longevity of currencies throughout history. If XBT were at the current-day maturity\n                level of Bitcoin, we would expect that it would have already seen meaningful use in denomination.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                In the long-run XBT becomes a simple bankless asset, like Bitcoin, except it can be used for\n                denomination and adapts to economic shocks.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </c-generic-section>\n\n\n          <c-generic-section top-divider>\n            <div class=\"container-xs\">\n              <h4>6.
