The curve allows supply to increase at a faster rate when the total market cap is low. The lag factor depends on the total supply. The higher the supply is, the higher is the possible lag factor. Minimum is 6 and maximum is 100."

In the case of fixed supply currencies like gold, silver, and BNB, these changes in demand are expressed entirely by changes in the value of the currency.",

For this reason, sudden shocks in demand can destabilize ecosystems supported by fixed supply assets.
